**Neuromodulation Project - Wilcox Lab, University of Utah**

**Overview:**
This repository contains code for data analysis and visualization conducted as part of the Neuromodulation Project at the Wilcox Lab, University of Utah. The project, spanning from 2021 to 2024, aims to investigate the effects of neuromodulation techniques, particularly focused ultrasound, on various aspects of neural activity in mice with the intent of suppressing epilepsy and seizures.

**Project Description:**
The Neuromodulation Project, led by Dr. Karen Wilcox, explores the application of focused ultrasound neuromodulation techniques in understanding and manipulating neural circuits in mice, specifically targeting epilepsy and seizures suppression. The research focuses on elucidating the mechanisms underlying focused ultrasound neuromodulation and its potential therapeutic applications in neurological disorders.
